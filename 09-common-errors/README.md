# 🚨 Errors Folder – How to Use This Section

This folder is designed to **teach Git & GitHub through real mistakes**.

Instead of only learning commands, you will learn:
- ❓ *Why something went wrong*
- 🧠 *How Git actually works*
- ✅ *How to fix the issue correctly*

This approach helps beginners **remember concepts**, not just commands.



## 📁 Folder Structure Explained

Each **sub-folder represents ONE common Git/GitHub error (question)**.

Example:

```text
errors/
├── 01-empty-folders-not-showing/
│   ├── WHY.md
│   └── EXPLANATION.md
├── 02-non-fast-forward-push/
│   ├── WHY.md
│   └── EXPLANATION.md
```

👉 The **folder name itself describes the error**.



## 🧠 Why Two Files Inside Each Error Folder?

Every error is explained using **two clear steps**.



### 1️⃣ `WHY.md` – The Confusion Stage

This file describes:
- What you tried to do
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- The confusion beginners usually face

Example:
> "I created an empty folder, committed it, pushed it… but it didn’t appear on GitHub. Why?"

This file helps you **relate to the problem first**.



### 2️⃣ `EXPLANATION.md` – The Learning Stage

This file contains:

- ✅ **The real reason** behind the error
- 🧠 The Git concept involved
- 🛠️ Step-by-step solution
- 💡 Best practices
- 🎯 Key takeaway

This is where the **actual learning happens**.



## 🔄 How You Should Read This Folder

1. Pick an error folder
2. Read `WHY.md` first
3. Try to answer the question yourself
4. Then read `EXPLANATION.md`

This simulates **real debugging in Git**.



## 🎓 Who Is This For?

- Git beginners
- Students learning version control
- First-time open-source contributors
- Anyone confused by Git errors



## ⭐ Key Idea Behind This Design

> **Errors are not failures — they are learning checkpoints.**

This folder exists to turn common Git mistakes into **clear understanding**.



Happy debugging 🚀  
If you understand these errors, you understand Git.
